# kishidaJSI
Documentation, tutorials, and code for the Kishida Lab Job Submission Interface (JSI)

The Kishida Lab JSI performs the following features:

* Manages all of the directory creation, file moving, and SLURM script generation
* Builds SLURM script based on userâ€™s input preferences and files
* Submits SLURM script using sbatch
* Error checking to ensure everything is in the right location
* Email alerts
* Archival function
* Flexible so users can run in default mode (JSI generates SLURM script) or users can submit their own modified scripts.

This repo contains three files:

1. A PowerPoint tutorial explaining the basics of high performance computing, the terminal environment, ssh, and the Kishida Lab JSI.
2. An html document containing a much more detailed version of the information in the PowerPoint.
3. A fully commented version of the JSI R script.

Please uses the issues page to report a bug, feature request, or a change to this interface.
